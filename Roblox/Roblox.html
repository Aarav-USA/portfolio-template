				<div>Roblox was a great journey starting in 2018. In 2018 November, creating a Roblox account was an accomplishment. Starting with a game to play was a given, with one of the most popular games, Murder Mystery 2. It was confusing at first, but with an overactive imagination, it changed a lot. Later, shifting from an iPad to a laptop was a big deal. But, it allowed access to the popular Roblox Studio, to create an MM2 of my own. Starting with a template was confusing to start with, giving up. But that was the beginning. More people interacting with Roblox created an opportunity and dissolved the confusion barrier. 

Spending a lot of time in the ecosystem, helped me understand the needs of the community. As more and more developers joined and created, inspiration took its course. Top-of-the-line shirts, pants, hats, and backpacks flooded the store in a matter of days. The best part was the mob of customers and the community it had created. The support that the community gave was invaluable. Sales started to skyrocket and cashing out $50 was a big deal. It pushed me from Roblox’s ecosystem at the same time because of the independence it brought. Donating the money to charity was a huge decision, considering it took a lot of hard work to earn. Donating it felt like a huge step, but was necessary due to the lack of financial planning. 

Creating more and more content led to a brick wall with slowing sales. Shifting the strategy to developing games, was somewhat of a success. Creating SpeedCity opened a new component of the ecosystem. The opportunities it brought were tremendous. A community that supported all my creations was all I needed to succeed. SpeedCity generated a fair amount of revenue from in-game purchases, all the way up to $50. The money donated to charity helped shape my way into the era of technology and software. 

The Roblox platform is immersive and a lot of barriers were a side effect. For example, neglect from Roblox moderators caused frustration with the moderation system. Roblox outsources employees to save money on hiring employees based in the USA. Roblox's moderators hired in India may speak English, yet there is still a culture barrier. A non-native speaker cannot moderate as well as somebody who speaks the native language because they understand more and are more comfortable with it. A barrier of confusion was created after adding extra bloat to the Roblox website with the marketing optimizations and empowerment to bigger developers on the recommended page. This fueled my anger with Roblox and its community, and I stepped down and handed the responsibilities of my creations to the community.

I learned a lot of things developing and working for the community. I learned how to interact with other people, along how to roll with it. Developing taught me how to work with advanced video game engines like Roblox Studio, Unity, and Unreal Engines. They helped shape my path into the technology/software era. This was a important experience because it didn't make me shine on one specific skill, it brought me together as a person, and taught me how to deal with life.
