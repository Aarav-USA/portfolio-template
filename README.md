# A website on GitHub?

Yes! A website on GitHub is a great idea... Why? A website on GitHub is a great idea because it shows your skills as a developer and beautifully formulates your website better than any other boring website builder. A website on Github also helps spread the idea of open source and learning just by developers viewing or forking your repository.
