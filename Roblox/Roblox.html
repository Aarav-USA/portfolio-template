				<div><span data-offset-key="ddsmv-0-0"><span data-text="true">Roblox was a great journey starting in 2018. In 2018 November, creating a Roblox account was an accomplishment. Starting with a game to play was a given, with one of the most popular games, Murder Mystery 2. It was confusing at first, but with an overactive imagination, it changed a lot. Later, shifting from an iPad to a laptop was a big deal. But, it allowed access to the popular Roblox Studio, to create an MM2 of my own. Starting with a template was confusing to start with, giving up. But that was the beginning. More people interacting with Roblox created an opportunity and dissolved the confusion barrier.<br/></span></span>

Top-of-the-line shirts, pants, hats, and backpacks flooded the store in a matter of days. The best part was the mob of customers and the community it had created. The support that the community gave was invaluable. Sales started to skyrocket and cashing out $50 was a big deal. It pushed me from Roblox’s ecosystem at the same time because of the independence it brought. Donating the money to charity was a huge decision, considering it took a lot of hard work to earn. Donating it felt like a huge step, but was necessary due to the lack of financial planning.

				<div><span data-offset-key="ddsmv-0-0"><span data-text="true">Creating more and more content led to a brick wall with slowing sales. Shifting the strategy to developing games, was somewhat of a success. Creating SpeedCity opened a new component of the ecosystem. The opportunities it brought were tremendous. A community that supported all my creations was all I needed to succeed.</span></span>

 Roblox platform is immersive and a lot of barriers were a side effect. 
For example, neglect from Roblox moderators caused frustration with the 
moderation system, due to the out-sourcing done by the platform. 
Roblox&#039;s moderators are mostly hired in India and, they may speak 
English, however there is still a culture barrier on what each word 
means to each person. A non-native speaker cannot moderate as well as 
somebody who speaks the native language because they understand more and
 are more comfortable with it. A barrier of confusion was created after 
adding extra bloat to the Roblox website with the marketing 
optimizations and empowerment to bigger developers on the recommended 
page. This eventually fueled my anger with Roblox and its community, and
 I eventually stepped down and handed the responsibilities of my creations to the community.</span></span><span data-offset-key="ddsmv-0-0"><span data-text="true"></span></span>
