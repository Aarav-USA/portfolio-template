                <div class="am-desc" id="inc4z">Roblox was a great journey starting from 2018. 
                    In 2018 November, creating a Roblox account was an accomplishment. 
                    Starting off with a game to play was a given, with one of the most popular games, Murder Mystery 2. 
                    It was confusing at first, but with my ever-growing knowledge, it changed a lot. 
                    Later, shifting to a laptop was a big deal however, it allowed access to the popular Roblox Studio, to create a MM2 of my own. 
                    Starting off with the volcano template created a barrier of confusion, eventually giving up. But that was just the beginning. 
                    With more people interacting with an intuitive design and system, eventually dissolved the barrier as more people assisted me through the journey. 
                    Spending a lot of time in the Roblox ecosystem started to feel more and more like a mistake. 
                    As immersive as the Roblox platform is, it created a barrier between the real world and a world that was constructed with an all or nothing mindset. 
                    Eventually, as more and more developers joined and created, inspiration was no feat. 
                    Immediately noticing and skill paved it’s way to finally making money off of UGC apparel. 
                    Top of the line shirts, clothing, hats, backpacks, pants, and t-shirts flooded the store in a matter of weeks. 
                    The best part about all of this was that it was all designed so people that couldn’t afford a lot of Roblox’s currency could easily buy the content. 
                    Sales started to skyrocket and cashing out $50 was a big deal. Slowly removing myself from Roblox’s ecosystem at the same time too. 
                    Donating the money to charity was a huge decision considering that it was a big sum of money. 
                    Donating it felt like a huge step, but was necessary due to the lack of financial planning. 
                    Creating more and more content led to more and more success but to no avail. 
                    Shifting the strategy to developing games and stopping the development of apparel, it was somewhat of a success. 
                    Creating Speed City opened a new component of the ecosystem, along with a new community. </div>
